## Overview and Background
> #### #1 Why do we need an employee portal?

As someone who grew up in this digitized age, there are two things that are important to our productivity :

- Ability to share and access informations and everything needed as easily and pain-free as possible
- Ability to connect with my teammates on more than just work

Our company portal / intranet needs to contain all of the information that keeps your company running. A successful intranet is one where users come back to stay on top of everything they need. The problem is, intranets aren’t often ingrained in a company’s processes or culture and forgotten. Either employees don’t know their intranet exists, don’t know how to use it, or don’t have any reason to.

In 2012, McKinsey & Company predicted that social intranet software could save companies 20-25% of white-collar labor costs. That calculation included:

- 7.0-8.0% less time spent on email.
- 5.5-6.5% less time spent searching and gathering information.
- 3.5-5.0% less time spent in staff meetings.
- 4.0-6.0% less time spent on role-specific tasks.

As these findings show, a social intranet will not eliminate all redundancy in the workplace. However, even small improvements in a few tasks performed by a majority of the workforce will add up to a staggering figure.
> #### #2 What’s the ROI?

- Increased productivity
- Increased employee engagement
- Reduced email traffic for admins
- Unified corporate communication
- Easier knowledge management and collaboration
- Increased internal vacancies fulfillment
- Faster onboarding process for new employee
- Increased training candidates
- Headcount reduction from automated functions
- Faster time to resolve employee issues
- Increased transparency between business units
- Reduced silo culture
> #### #3 What’s the objectives?

|Objectives|How?|
|----|----|
|Reduce IT burden|With content management system available, every changes can be done by HR or other admins without requesting to IT|
|Decrease staff turnover|Research shows that for every increase in staff satisfaction levels, there is also an increase in retention. <br><br> An intranet can increase satisfaction by improving engagement, keeping employees informed, communicating mission and purpose, and supporting a common culture|
|Enable staff to self-serve, reducing dependency on HR|Centralized storage of critical policies, forms, procedures, and company information on the intranet will allow staff to find information themselves, rather than going directly to HR.|
|Reduce time employees spend searching for information by|Research suggests workers spend on average 19% of their working week searching and gathering information. <br><br>An intranet, as part of an integrated and centralized digital workplace, provides a single, searchable version of truth, reducing time spent searching|

::: warning Assumptions
12,000 staff in organization (3000 permanent & contract, 9000 outsource)  
Average minumum salary (UMR) is on Rp3,000,000  
40 working hours a week (5 x 8hours)  
Salary per hour = Rp18,750,-  
<hr>
**-- IF 1% of time is saved per month for each objectives**  
1% from 160 hours (month) = 1,6 hours  
Salary for 1,6 hours = Rp30,000  
For all employee (using average UMR) = 12,000 * Rp30,000 = Rp360,000,000 saving per month  
If every objectives can save 1%, then in total there will be 4 x Rp360,000,000 = Rp 1,440,000,000,- saved.  
<hr>
**_1,44 bio rupiah can be saved monthly, with assumption every employee's salary is on average UMR, and only 1% of time is reduced for each objective_**
